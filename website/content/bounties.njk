            The <span class="fw-bold"><a href="/foundation/">MonoGame Foundation</a></span> is using a bounty system to propose paid
			incentives to improve the project.
        </p>
		<p>
            The list of all open bounties is available on <a href="https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/8120">the
			project's GitHub repository</a>.
        </p>

        <h1 id="how" class="fw-bold"><a href="#how">How do bounties work?</a></h1>
        <p>
            If you would like to propose your services to fulfill a bounty, please send us your references and a proposed schedule to
			complete the bounty by e-mail (please indicate which bounty you are applying to): <a href="mailto:biz@monogame.net">biz@monogame.net</a>
        </p>
		<p>
            Each bounty will have a date for applications listed in its description. This will usually be about 2 weeks from the time the bounty is opened.
            Once the date has been reached the bounty coordinator will review the applications. If there are no applicants, the bounty will remain open.
            With input from the rest of the board members a successful applicant will be chosen. The bounty coordinator will then let you know of the decision.
            The decision will also be made public on the specific bounty page. If the decision is favorable, a service agreement will
            be proposed to you to legally bind both parties. You may also be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement with the Foundation.
        </p>
		<p>
			The Foundation board will consider your expertise and proposed schedule. Unless specified, only one application
			per bounty will be selected and locked to complete the bounty. Past that point, bounties will be closed for applications.
			Therefore, bounties are not competitions with multiple people racing to complete them. The board will look for the most
			suitable application.
