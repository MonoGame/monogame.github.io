## 3.8.5-preview.2 Release Announcement

The MonoGame Foundation is pleased to announce Preview 2 of the 3.8.5 Release!
[Grab it here](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=MonoGame) or from within your favourite IDE.

The highlights in this release are the new StartKit templates, with new VK/DX12 targets included.

Also of note:

* It includes multiple platforms, if you do not have the iOS / Android workloads, then just remove them from the solution to test. (easy to do with the new `slnx` solution format)
* No additional requirements from the other platforms.
* Vulkan and DX12 are previews and there may be issues.
