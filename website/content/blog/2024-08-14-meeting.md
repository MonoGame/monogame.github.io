## Outcomes

Enough of all the waiting already, lets just ship this thing, we can ship more later.

This was the focus of this months meeting, as you will see in the recent [announcement here](./2024-08-16-monogame-382.md).  We have discussed, argued and eventually reached the consensus that there is nothing stopping "Just Shipping" the current state of the `Development` branch "as is".  Everything else we are working on can just ship when they are ready.

So in case you missed it:

### [MonoGame 3.8.2 has shipped](./2024-08-16-monogame-382.md)

More releases to follow.

### Commemoration to Bill Reiss

In recognition of Bill Reiss's contribution to both MonoGame and technology education in general, it was proposed and accepted to commemorate the [3.8.2 release](./2024-08-16-monogame-382.md) to our dear lost friend.  Long may his kind and helpful personality be remembered.

### Single Project Support, in review

There was a discussion about how we could add `SingleProject` support similar to how .NET Maui projects are structured. This might be something we can do in the future.

### Need for a Full Time board member

Given that development and running of the Foundation is not running as fast as we would like, it was proposed that we select a full time board member to further accelerate MonoGame's development, at least on a limited basis at first to see how it works out.  As it turns out, one of the existing board members will shortly become "permanently" available it seems fitting that they are offered the role.

This is all subject to agreement with the legal team and justifying we have sufficient work items to be completed (we will always have too much work) to warrant their appointment.  Like any other Open-Source roles, this is not going to be at market rate and has to be sustainable by the Foundation for the term of their engagement. (almost the same as the bounties).

More news later as this develops.

## Bounty tracker

The [Bounties Tracker](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/8120) continues, although admittedly we have not had as much interest to date for all items to date and their speed is not as fast as we would like, this is likely due to the bounty values for which we will continually keep reviewing as demand arises.

## Keeping the ball rolling

With `3.8.2` released, we are not "stepping off the gas" and will endeavour to keep the momentum going with MonoGame, as we will commit to "shipping each feature as it is ready", first to public preview NuGet packages and then push with the next 6 monthly (ish) release.

Keep us honest, keep us going and let us know how you feel regarding releases.
