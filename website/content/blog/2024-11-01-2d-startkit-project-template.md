## 2D StartKit Project Template


### What to expect

For game devs who are new to MonoGame, we’ve been working on a 2D StartKit project template, that targets Android, iOS, macOS, Linux and Windows, so you can hit the ground running. Here’s a video (it’s a bit rough and ready, we’ll make a better one in future) of what’s planned. Leave comments and let us know what you think. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa8u_n93nxc .
