## The first of many

![Celebration](images/announcement.gif)

### MonoGame 3.8.2 has been officially released

We are proud to announce the official release of **MonoGame 3.8.2**, the first of many releases we hope to start shipping more regularly with the formation of the [MonoGame Foundation](https://monogame.net/about/).

::: tip In memoriam for Bill Reiss
Due to the passing of a [dear friend to MonoGame Bill Reiss](https://monogame.net/blog/2024-08-12-inmemoriam/), the 3.8.2 release commemorates his achievements and past contributions.  His lifelong dedication to promoting open-source game development and championing technology education will be long remembered.

We thank you Bill for everything you have given!
:::

This is mainly a maintenance release [including all the fixes and changes](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/compare/v3.8.1_HOTFIX...434d100) since the last release (over 300 commits), this includes:

* Update to .NET 8, including the MGCB tool (now a local tool rather than global, allowing different projects to use different versions)
* Removal of Windows UWP due to Microsoft shutting support for it (you can still use UWP if you remain on 3.8.1)
* Updated to building dependencies to improve support.
* New documentation, including the continuing migration of the [older XNA documentation](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_to_know/).
* A MASSIVE clean-up of the MonoGame XML documentation, big shout out to (@AristurtleDev and his team).
* Build system improvements (mainly a MonoGame building backend thing).
* Various bugfixes to so many areas of the Framework.

::: warning Breaking changes
The situation for Mac/Linux users in 3.8.2 has not changed and you still need to use the alternate steps for building content.  However, the a fast following release will include a major update for Mac / Linux to make the process a lot simpler and easier to use.

See [this article](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_vscode.html?tabs=windows#apple-silicon-known-issues) for more info.

### Most notable changes

There is a lot to take in, even with a maintenance release like this (from the list above), but these are the key points:

#### Support for .NET 8 projects

As MonoGame and the MGCB tool are now built natively with .NET 8, all the NEW project templates have also been updated to .NET 8.  The end-to-end update will see performance improvements with the framework as well as the other language benefits from C# 12.

#### The MGCB tool is now Local

Rather than being installed as a `Global` tool which affected all projects using MonoGame, with 3.8.2, the MGCB tool is now `local`, meaning each project can use and manage its own dependencies with the MGCB tool.  This has been possible for a while, but it is now official with 3.8.2.

## New release schedule

![Release Schedule](images/schedule.gif)

One of the promises we made was to accelerate both the development and shipping of releases and while we have been hard at work forming [Bounties](https://monogame.net/bounties/), pushing hard to get the [Documentation](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/index.html) updated and expanded, we admittedly have fallen short on getting more releases out.  **THAT IS ALL ABOUT TO CHANGE**

As has been hinted, following the shipping of the backlog that has built up in the development branch over the last 2 years (the 3.8.2 release), we are officially committing to the following:

* New preview releases will be available via NuGet as new features become available.

  This will include all committed functionality in the `develop` branch that passes base testing,  ideally on a Bi-Monthly schedule (approximately every two months), assuming there are changes to push.

* New full release every 6 months (or sooner if required).

  This will encompass a fully tested release shipped with the features built up over that time.

Both schedules are subject to change to meet the demands of the community, if there is a demand to ship sooner we will.
