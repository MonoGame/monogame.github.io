### `3.8.5` Preview features

The `3.8.5` release also includes preview editions of two new platforms and the Content Builder solution:

* Native Vulkan Platform Support.
* Native DirectX12 Platform Support.
* New Content Builder solution (replacing MGCB editor).
* New StartKit templates using the Content Builder.

::: info Binaries access only for new Platforms
The MonoGame team are working hard on the packaging for the new platforms but it is not ready yet.  The platforms are fully deployed in source and are currently only available either by cloning/referencing source or by using the [binaries release](#accessing-the-binary-release) detailed below.

### Known issues with Preview Features

The primary reason the new features are released in a preview state is that additional testing is required with a more varied selection of projects, assets and "real world" projects.  Currently, the following issues are known and require more replication to resolve fixes:

* Occasionally you might get the following error from the new Content Builder when building from a clean directory tree using dotnet build from the command line.

  ```text
    error MSB3073: The command "
    Content/bin/Debug/net9.0/Content build -p DesktopGL -s Assets -o Platforms/Desktop/bin/Debug/net9.0/ -i /Platforms/Desktop/obj/Debug/net9.0/" exited with code 255.
  ```

  The problem in this case seems to be the implicit restore is causing one or more of the content files to be locked.
  
  The work around for now is to run `dotnet restore` first.

* Issues identified when using the new Content Builder solution on Arch Linux, which has been identified as a Wine issue.

* MacOS builds need a [fix for backwards compatibility to the cmake arguments](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/9013#issuecomment-3655710933) of our native dependencies, it's an easy one, and will fix many macOS hurdles.

* FAudio/XAudio has issues in DynamicSoundEffectInstance, which needs further testing.

* Vulkan has single frame screen tearing in random instances.  Currently not reproducible, so help is needed with projects that might encounter it.

Any assistance the wider community can provide in creating projects that identify issues for resolution is greatly appreciated.
