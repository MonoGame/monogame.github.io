## MonoGame Foundation Releases Second Title With Full source!

Old School Adventure, an original XNA title released on Xbox and then subsequently ported to Windows Phone, back in the day, has been migrated and updated for the latest MonoGame release.

You can find the license and full source for the game here:

## [Old School Adventure release from ZenithMoon Studios](https://github.com/ZenithMoonStudios/OldSchoolAdventure)

Like the release of [Boo! Greedy Kid by FlyingOakGames](https://github.com/FlyingOakGames/GreedyKid), this is also released under an educational license and is **NOT** for commercial distribution.

We hope you enjoy and support both of these projects and find the information within them useful when making your own games. 

We'll be bringing you more soon!
