The MonoGame Foundation pleased to offer a thank-you gift to our sponsors.

## Festive Gift for all Sponsors

As mentioned on the AMA on the 17th of December, as a big thank you for all your support over the last year (or two), we have put together this little sample for everyone. Its not a full game or anything like that, but it does show off some of the things you can do with MonoGame in 3D. The features of the sample are

* Real time shadow mapping
* Skinned Animated Models
* Instanced Snow particles
* CPU side Vertex Displacement to simulate accumulating snow
* Basic WASD Flying Camera.
* Screenshot support
* Uses the new preview Content Builder
