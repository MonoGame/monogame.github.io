## Agenda

This time we'll have -

* Team Updates on:
  * Bounties
  * Starter Kits
  * New Streaming plans
* MonoGame Book announcement
* Get in Shape - Shape library overview and dev talk​ by Jean-David Moisan (Apos) ​
* Q&A from the Community

If you prefer to just type, the call will also use Discord's text features and the team will be on hand to respond too.

::: note Only during open hours
The "Open Hours" chat will only be open during the meeting (and clearing up any outstanding questions afterward), it will not be a general support forum.  The team are making this time available to the community, so please do not abuse it.

If you have queries beyond the meeting times, then we recommend you use the rest of the Discord channel.
:::

We look forward to meeting and hearing from you then!

## The Meeting Schedule

If you can't make this month, all is not lost. Each month, one week on from the MonoGame Foundation monthly board meeting, the group has agreed to host a series of sessions to both communicate announcements to the community and also open the floor up to questions the community has about MonoGame operations or ask questions that they have about the framework.

* MonoGame Board meetings - 2nd Wednesday each month
* MonoGame "Open Hours" - 3rd Wednesday each month - 5PM UTC
