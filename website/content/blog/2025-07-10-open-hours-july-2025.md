The "Open Hours" chat will only be open during the meeting (and clearing up any outstanding questions afterward), it will not be a general support forum.  The team are making this time available to the community, so please do not abuse it.

We look forward to meeting and hearing from you then!

## The Meeting Schedule

If you can't make this month, all is not lost. Each month, one week on from the MonoGame Foundation monthly board meeting, the group has agreed to host a series of sessions to both communicate announcements to the community and also open the floor up to questions the community has about MonoGame operations or ask questions that they have about the framework.

* MonoGame Board meetings - 2nd Wednesday each month
* MonoGame "Open Hours" - 3rd Wednesday each month - 5PM UTC
