## Outcomes

- Larger MonoGame templates to move to the MonoGame.Samples repository, no downturn effect on users who will still use `dotnet new` from the CLI.
- 3.8.3 release is on track for maintenance fixes in November.
- Tutorials page to be revised to organize older content (with warning) lower, with current/valid tutorials to the top.
- Call for new content to submit to the community tutorials page.
- Open Hours for November will focus on the Vulkan/DX 12 native update, with Q&A.
- All bounties are progressing, although not at a pace that was expected.  Used for lessons learned in future bounties.
- Year-in-review post to be published.
- Renewed focus to prioritize content for active Patreons and drive value to contributors.
- New swag showcased, we finally found a good printer.
