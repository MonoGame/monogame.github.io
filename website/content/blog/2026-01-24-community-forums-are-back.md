## The Community Forums are back

After a mammoth month of work, fixes, updates and all round security review, we are proud to announce that the MonoGame Community is now back online and ready for new business.

### [https://community.monogame.net/](https://community.monogame.net/)

If you have ever searched on "a search engine" for any query related to MonoGame, then this is the site you likely landed on, packed with answers, questions and general feedback on building MonoGame games.

## Where did it go, why was it closed?

The site never really went away and has still been operational, all that changed was that new users could not create accounts.  Existing users could still use the site, but for everyone else, it was effectively read-only.

We did not take the decision lightly, but we had no choice as it was targeted by malicious hackers and spammers who found the site and then set their bots against it.  It created unimaginable work for the maintainers and moderators to clear out the spam and harmful messages, so we had to take the regrettable decision to close it.

Discord and GitHub discussions tried to replace it, but sadly these lack so many of the features that MonoGame relied on, not least of all was SEO. These sources are not indexed by search engines, so finding an answer in reality became more painful.

These were dark times, although the community did come together to help each other out.  We are so very proud of our community.

## The gates have been reopened with renewed purpose

Thanks to the latest donations and the increased financial security provided by Sponsors, we were able to begin the much needed work to bring the site back online:

- Updated the Discourse server to the latest (no small feat!).
- Implemented security updates and access controls to better gate access to the site and try and shut out the bots.
- Reviewed new user capabilities, in line with other communities.
- Conversations with the Discourse community to better protect the server for the future.

And we are not stopping there, we are planning on further investments to the site to modernise it and also find better hosting to ensure its uptime.

## Welcome back to the jungle

The existing channels are not going away, everyone is free to use whichever service suits them best and we will do our best to keep on top of it all.

So what are you waiting for? Get searching, get posting and if you have them, ask your questions.

::: note Feedback
We have opened a post on GitHub discussions for feedback about the site (which might sound odd since we launched the site), it is just an easy place to collate feedback in a single location that everyone should already be familiar with.
