The MonoGame Foundation is proud to announce a new level of engagement with the MonoGame community through a series of monthly AMA sessions aimed at improving communication.

::: note Following the crowd
This all came about due to [Microsoft hosting their own "Open Hours" sessions](https://discord.gg/msftgamedev) recently and some of the MonoGame community who also join that call expressed an interest in MonoGame doing the same, we agreed.
:::

## Initial Meeting

The inaugural MonoGame "Open Hours" meeting will be on:

### Wednesday 16th October - 12:00 EDT, 16:00 UTC/GMT, 17:00 CET 

### Channel and Connection Details

#### [MonoGame Community discord - Open Hours channel](https://discord.gg/monogame?event=1295042873430905024)

## The Meeting Schedule

Each month, one week on from the MonoGame Foundation monthly board meeting, the group has agreed to host a series of sessions to both communicate announcements to the community and also open the floor up to questions the community has about MonoGame operations or ask questions that they have about the framework.

* MonoGame Board meetings - 2nd Wednesday each month
* "MonoGame "Open Hours" - 3rd Wednesday each month - 4PM UTC

## Agenda

We will learn as we go for these new sessions. The first call will be an open forum where we will invite developers to talk and ask questions and we will do our best to respond.  
Going forward we aim to talk about a recent announcement or feature and then open the floor to questions.

If you prefer to just type, the call will also use Discord's text features and the team will be on hand to respond too.

::: note Only during open hours
Following suit with Microsoft's process, the "Open Hours" chat will only be open during the meeting (and clearing up any outstanding questions afterward), it will not be a general support forum.  The team are making this time available to the community, so please do not abuse it.

If you have queries beyond the meeting times, then we recommend you use the rest of the Discord channel.

We look forward to meeting and hearing from you then!
