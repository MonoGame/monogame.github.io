- Full-time appointment.
- Releases are go.

## Content Pipeline enhancements.

We discussed and decided to allow loading of raw content files (pngs, wav, etc) via ContentManager as a fallback when an XNB is not found. This makes things nicer for users that dislike pre-compiling content, but allows you to change that decision later without rewriting your game code.

- [`Content.Load<Texture>("asset name");`](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/8481)
- [`Content.Load<SoundEffect>("asset name");`](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/8482)
- [`Content.Load<Song>("asset name");`](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/8483)
- [`Content.Load<Video>("asset name");`](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/8484)

::: note For later
At this time, shaders and models will still have to use the Content Pipeline as there are many dependencies involved in handling these kinds of content.  We will address them in time, but for now, they will have to wait.

### Release Improvements

Like the Content Pipeline improvements above, the same view has also been turned to the way we release MonoGame today via NuGets.  We recognize this might not be a 100% fit for all as NuGet does impose some limitations, especially for offline use.

To this end, we have also kicked off two other streams of work:

- [Update build pipeline to generate a "Complete" Source package for releases](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/8485)
- [Update build pipeline to generate a "Binaries" Source package for releases](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/8486)

### Bounties, Bounties, Bounties

Work continues on all existing bounties, but these updates were at the top of mind for discussion.

- DX12 / GDK support is a ready and completing final adoption
- The [Basis Universal](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/8456) bounty is complete
- [Shared native base]](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/8242) is nearing completion and will be usable in the coming months.

### Full Time maintainer - full steam ahead

Now that we have had an official meeting and preceded over a vote on the subject, we have given the go-ahead for a full-time member to take on the role of "MonoGame Maintainer"

The final details to award this role are still being worked out, but the Foundation has to be able to afford this appointment and it likely will not be at "market rates" as this is a non-profit organization after all.

## Updates releases and schedules

One month on from the `3.8.2` release and we are already making plans for next month's release, assuming the recent PR merges warrent it.  We were very serious about keeping pace and we are tightly focused on it.
