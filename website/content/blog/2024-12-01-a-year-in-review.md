# What a year it has been!

It has been a year since we announced that we received a very generous [donation from Re-Logic](https://x.com/MonoGameTeam/status/1724164491363967465) and the formation of the MonoGame Foundation. A lot has happened.

### So far in the last year we:

* Increased recurring subscriptions (Patreon, GitHub & PayPal) to almost $2000 a month
* Refreshed the MonoGame website with more focus on the creators and their titles \- Thanks Chris (ArisTurtle)  
* Overhauled the documentation site and increased the content by more than 500%, with even more to come  
* Released 3.8.2 (.NET 8)

* #### Appointed to the board

  * President - Dean Ellis  
  * Chairman - Marko Jeremic  
  * Secretary - Simon Jackson  
  * Banking - Tom Spilman  
  * Member - Thomas Altenburger  
  * Treasurer - Dominique Louis

* Regular board meetings with full transparency, keeping the community involved in the plans and actions for MonoGame to take it into the next decade.
