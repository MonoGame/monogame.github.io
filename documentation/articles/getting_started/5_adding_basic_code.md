# Adding Basic Code

This tutorial will go over adding basic logic to your game, continuing from where [Adding Content](4_adding_content.md) left off.

---

## Positioning the content

First, you need to add few new variables in the Game1.cs class file: one for position and one for speed.

```csharp
public class Game1 : Game
{
    Texture2D ballTexture;
    Vector2 ballPosition;
    float ballSpeed;
```

Next, you need to initialize them. Find the **Initialize** method and add the following lines.

```csharp
// TODO: Add your initialization logic here
ballPosition = new Vector2(_graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth / 2,
_graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight / 2);
ballSpeed = 100f;

base.Initialize();
```

With this, you are setting the ball's starting position to the center of the screen based on the dimensions of the screen determined by the current **BackBufferWidth** and **BackBufferHeight** that was obtained from the Graphics Device (the current resolution the game is running at).

Lastly, change the Draw method to draw the ball at the correct position.  Find the **Draw** method and update the **spriteBatch.Draw** call to:

```csharp
_spriteBatch.Draw(ballTexture, ballPosition, Color.White);
```

Now run the game.

As you can see, the ball is not quite centered yet. That is because the default origin of a texture is its top-left corner, or (0, 0) relative to the texture, so the ball texture is drawn with its top-left corner exactly centered, rather than its actual center. You can specify a different origin when drawing, as shown in the following code snippet. The new origin takes into account the height and width of the image when drawing:

```csharp
_spriteBatch.Draw(
    ballTexture,
    ballPosition,
    null,
    Color.White,
    0f,
    new Vector2(ballTexture.Width / 2, ballTexture.Height / 2),
    Vector2.One,
    SpriteEffects.None,
    0f
);
```

This change adds a few extra parameters to the spriteBatch.Draw call, but do not worry about that for now. This new code sets the actual center (width / 2 and height / 2) of the image as its origin (drawing point). 

Now the image will get drawn to the center of the screen.

## Getting user input

Time to set up some movement. Find the **Update** method in the Game1.cs class file and add:

```csharp
// TODO: Add your update logic here
var kstate = Keyboard.GetState();

if (kstate.IsKeyDown(Keys.Up))
{
    ballPosition.Y -= ballSpeed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds;
}

if (kstate.IsKeyDown(Keys.Down))
{
    ballPosition.Y += ballSpeed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds;
}

if (kstate.IsKeyDown(Keys.Left))
{
    ballPosition.X -= ballSpeed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds;
}

if (kstate.IsKeyDown(Keys.Right))
{
    ballPosition.X += ballSpeed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds;
}

base.Update(gameTime);
```

The following is a line-by-line analysis of the above code.

```csharp
var kstate = Keyboard.GetState();
```

This code fetches the current keyboard state ('Keyboard.GetState()') and stores it into a variable called **kstate**.

```csharp
if (kstate.IsKeyDown(Keys.Up))
```

This line checks to see if the Up Arrow key is pressed.

```csharp
    ballPosition.Y -= ballSpeed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds;
```

If the **Up Arrow** key is pressed, the ball moves using the value you assigned to **ballSpeed**. The reason why **ballSpeed** is multiplied by **gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds** is because, when not using fixed time step, the time between Update calls varies. To account for this, the ballSpeed is multiplied by the amount of time that has passed since the last Update call. The result is that the ball appears to move at the same speed regardless of what framerate the game happens to be running at.

> Try experimenting with what happens if you do not multiply the **ballSpeed** by **gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds**, to see the difference it makes.

The rest of the lines of code do the same thing but for the Down, Left and Right Arrow keys, and down, left, and right movement, respectively.

If you run the game, you should be able to move the ball with the arrow keys.

Another option for user input is the Joystick class. Setting up input for the Joystick is very similar to setting up keyboard input. Find the **Update** method in the Game1.cs class file and add:
```csharp
if(Joystick.LastConnectedIndex == 0)
{
    JoystickState jstate = Joystick.GetState(0);
	
	float updatedBallSpeed = ballSpeed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds;
	
    if (jstate.Axes[1] < 0)
    {
        ballPosition.Y -= updatedBallSpeed;
    }
	else if (jstate.Axes[1] > 0)
    {
        ballPosition.Y += updatedBallSpeed;
    }

    if (jstate.Axes[0] < 0)
    {
        ballPosition.X -= updatedBallSpeed;
    }
    else if (jstate.Axes[0] > 0)
    {
        ballPosition.X += updatedBallSpeed;
    }
}
```

The following is a line-by-line analysis of the above code.
```csharp
if(Joystick.LastConnectedIndex == 0)
```

This code assumes that we have a single controller plugged into our device. LastConnectedIndex is the index of the last connected controller. The default is -1, which would mean no controller is plugged in. 
If there is no controller, the code inside the if statement will be skipped over.

```csharp
JoystickState jstate = Joystick.GetState(0);
```

This code fetches the current joystick state ('Joystick.GetState(0)') and stores it into a variable called **jstate**.

```csharp
if (jstate.Axes[1] < 0)
```

This line checks whether the second Joystick axis is less than 0. The Joystick class stores multiple axis of direction for anything with an integer based range. For any number of 2D axis sticks, it stores it in an x,y format inside of an integer array. 
The axis of movement for 2D joysticks goes from -32768 to 32768 on most modern controllers. Aiming the Joystick upwards results in a negative value on the Y-axis ('Axes[1]').

The rest of the lines of the code do the same thing but for their relevant x and y directions.

If you run the game, you should be able to move the ball with the left Joystick on your controller if one is plugged in.

You will probably notice that the ball slightly moves on its own. This will likely be the result of your Joystick having a slight drift. You can fix that by adding a deadzone and changing the conditions to use this deadzone.

```csharp
public class Game1 : Game
{
    Texture2D ballTexture;
    Vector2 ballPosition;
    float ballSpeed;

    int deadZone;
```

Next, you need to initialize the deadzone. Find the **Initialize** method and add the following lines.

```csharp
deadZone = 4096;
```

Now, replace the conditions for the Joystick movement in **Update** to the following:

```csharp
if (jstate.Axes[1] < -deadZone)
{
    ballPosition.Y -= updatedBallSpeed;
}
else if (jstate.Axes[1] > deadZone)
{
    ballPosition.Y += updatedBallSpeed;
}

if (jstate.Axes[0] < -deadZone)
{
    ballPosition.X -= updatedBallSpeed;
}
else if (jstate.Axes[0] > deadZone)
{
    ballPosition.X += updatedBallSpeed;
}
```

If you run the game and move the Joystick around, you should notice that your Joystick has to move a decent distance before the ball starts moving. This is what a deadZone does, it allows for there to be a minimum distance before the input is reflected in the game.
> Try experimenting with what happens when you change the value of the deadZone. Mess around and find an amount that fits your project.

You will probably notice that the ball is not confined to the window. You can fix that by setting bounds onto the ballPosition after it has already been moved to ensure it cannot go further than the width or height of the screen.

```csharp
if (kstate.IsKeyDown(Keys.Right))
{
    ballPosition.X += ballSpeed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds;
}

if (ballPosition.X > _graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth - ballTexture.Width / 2)
{
    ballPosition.X = _graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth - ballTexture.Width / 2;
}
else if (ballPosition.X < ballTexture.Width / 2)
{
    ballPosition.X = ballTexture.Width / 2;
}

if (ballPosition.Y > _graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight - ballTexture.Height / 2)
{
    ballPosition.Y = _graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight - ballTexture.Height / 2;
}
else if (ballPosition.Y < ballTexture.Height / 2)
{
    ballPosition.Y = ballTexture.Height / 2;
}

base.Update(gameTime);
```

Now run the game to test for yourself that the ball cannot go beyond the window bounds any more.

Happy Coding ^^
